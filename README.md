𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: Implementation of a Singly-Linked ("SLC.cpp") and, a Doubly-Linked("DLL.cpp") list - with associated header files ("SLC.h" and "DLL.h"), a makefile to efficiently compile, and a Driver Program to execute the program perform functionality tests. 

𝙎𝙇𝘾.𝙘𝙥𝙥: Class and type definitions for the SortedList. Items are in strict ascending order; duplicates are not allowed.  Simple array-based list implementation.

𝘿𝙇𝙇.𝙘𝙥𝙥: Implementation file for the 'SortedList' Class; Pointer-based dummy-headed circular singly-linked list implementation.

𝙎𝙇𝘾.𝙝: Class and type definitions for the SortedList. Items are in strict ascending order; duplicates are not allowed. Simple array-based list implementation.

𝘿𝙇𝙇.𝙝: Class and type definitions for the 'SortedList' Items are in strict ascending order; duplicates are not allowed. Dynamic storage dummy-headed circular singly-linked list implementation.

𝘿𝙍𝙄𝙑𝙀𝙍_𝙎𝙇𝘾_𝘿𝙇𝙇.𝙘𝙥𝙥: Simple-minded driver for exercising the SortedList methods. Original concept based on a variation of Carrano (5th Ed.), Chapter 3, pp. 133-134.  NOTE: This program is not a comprehensive test program.

𝙢𝙖𝙠𝙚𝙛𝙞𝙡e: Makefile to efficiently compile with the cmd 'make' command.
