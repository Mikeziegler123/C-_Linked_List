𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: Implementation of a Singly-Linked, ("SLC.cpp") and Doubly-Linked("DLL.cpp") lists with associated header files("SLC.h" and "DLL.h"), makefile to compile, and a Driver Program("DRIVER_SLC_DLL.cpp")

𝙎𝙇𝘾.𝙘𝙥𝙥: Class and type definitions for the SortedList. Items are in strict ascending order; duplicates are not allowed.  Simple array-based list implementation.

𝘿𝙇𝙇.𝙘𝙥𝙥: Implementation file for the 'SortedList' Class; Pointer-based dummy-headed circular singly-linked list implementation.

𝙎𝙇𝘾.𝙝: Class and type definitions for the SortedList. Items are in strict ascending order; duplicates are not allowed. Simple array-based list implementation.

𝘿𝙇𝙇.𝙝: Class and type definitions for the 'SortedList' Items are in strict ascending order; duplicates are not allowed. Dynamic storage dummy-headed circular singly-linked list implementation.

𝘿𝙍𝙄𝙑𝙀𝙍_𝙎𝙇𝘾_𝘿𝙇𝙇.𝙘𝙥𝙥: Simple-minded driver for exercising the SortedList methods. Original concept based on a variation of Carrano (5th Ed.), Chapter 3, pp. 133-134.  NOTE: This program is not a comprehensive test program.

𝙢𝙖𝙠𝙚𝙛𝙞𝙡e: makefile to easily compile with 'make' command.
